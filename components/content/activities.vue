    <dt>Tai Chi</dt>
    <dd>I'm old so I needed an effective physical maintenance routine. Tai chi is fantastic.</dd>

    <dt>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</dt>
    <dd>Started in December 2024. Incredible workout while learning self-defense as a side effect.</dd>

    <dt>Bouldering</dt>
    <dd>
      Friends got me hooked sometime around 2018. Highest grade I've ever sent is a V6, though I haven't been
      consistent in the past few years, so that's dropped pretty significantly.

    <dt>Latin Dancing</dt>
    <dd>Started in late 2010. Salsa, bachata, and merengue. Would love to learn more styles.</dd>

    <dt>Karaoke</dt>
    <dd>This has become a regular activity in my circles, and I will sing with my people sober for hours.</dd>

    <dt>Super Smash Bros</dt>
    <dd>
      I used to compete in Super Smash Bros tournaments under the tag "Tohfoo". Highest I've ever placed was
      33rd at a 512-man tournament.

    <dt>Coffee</dt>
    <dd>
      My wife does this professionally and is looking to start her own coffee cart. She's been teaching me
      everything I know about coffee. Turns out the rabbit hole goes beyond anything I've imagined. La
      Marzocco is the way.

    <dt>Piano</dt>
    <dd>
      After being classically trained, I'm trying to learn how to play piano by ear. Love playing jazz and
      Studio Ghibli tracks.

    <dt>Languages</dt>
    <dd>
      I grew up speaking Japanese and Mandarin and have been able to retain conversational ability in both. I'm
      currently taking tutoring lessons in Mandarin to go beyond "house" Chinese. Interested in picking up
      Filipino and Korean.
