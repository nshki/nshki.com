        Working through this currently, but the ex-director of public policy at Meta

        like I can really see through her eyes.

      <p>Immersive, captivating, and horrifying.</p>

        This book made me realize that I actually like history, despite my academic
        experience with it. This details, with research through various primary sources,
        the <em>bogglingly</em> bloody history of the United States' involvement with
        foreign regimes in the 20th century.

        relationships. Incredible insight through real-life sessions with his patients

      author="Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga"
    >
      <p>
        An intensly thought-provoking dialogue between a youth and an philosopher about
        framing life in a different way to find true happiness. Although the dialogue is
        in the context of modern life, there are still Japanese cultural biases that sneak
        in, which I found to be fun because I'm a third-culture kid in the US.
