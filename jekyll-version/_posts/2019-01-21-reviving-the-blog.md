summary: Motivations and thoughts around reviving my personal blog.
---

For the past several years, I've been treating my website primarily as an online résumé of sorts -- I focused on making it flashy, telling my professional story, and selling myself.

Not to say those things aren't important, but I think my focus has been off the mark. I'm hoping that returning to blogging will help me organize my thoughts better and give me a better way to reflect on learnings. Publishing resourceful posts (hopefully) and giving employers a better picture of how I think and work are positive side effects.

I spent a little time recycling illustrations from my previous site for this blog, and was able to write it in Gatsby fairly quickly. If you haven't tried [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) yet, I highly recommend it!

I _was_ fairly proud of my previous site, however, so I decided to [keep it alive on GitHub Pages](https://nshki.github.io/nshki.com-2017/). Would like to write about the process I went through to build that sometime.

Looking forward to writing more regularly as 2019 trucks forward.
